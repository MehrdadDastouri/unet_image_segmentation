# Image Segmentation with U-Net

This project implements the U-Net model for image segmentation. U-Net is widely used in applications like medical imaging and object segmentation.

## Features
- Implements U-Net architecture for binary segmentation.
- Supports custom datasets with images and masks.
- Visualizes segmentation results after training.

## How to Run
1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Place input images in `data/images`.
   - Place corresponding masks in `data/masks`.
